						And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

						And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

						And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.

					<seg id="b.GEN.1.11" type="verse">
						And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.1.12" type="verse">
						And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

						And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.

						And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,

					<seg id="b.GEN.1.21" type="verse">
						And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
